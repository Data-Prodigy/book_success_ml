Chinua Achebe,There Was a Country,"From the legendary author of Things Fall Apart comes this long-awaited memoir recalling Chinua Achebe's personal experiences of and reflections on the Biafran War, one of Nigeria's most tragic civil wars Chinua Achebe, the author of Things Fall Apart, was a writer whose moral courage and storytelling gifts have left an enduring stamp on world literature. There Was a Country was his long-awaited account of coming of age during the defining experience of his life: the Nigerian Civil War, also known as the Biafran War of 1967-1970. It became infamous around the world for its impact on the Biafrans, who were starved to death by the Nigerian government in one of the twentieth century's greatest humanitarian disasters. Caught up in the atrocities were Chinua Achebe and his young family. Achebe, already a world-renowned novelist, served his Biafran homeland as a roving cultural ambassador, witnessing the war's full horror first-hand. Immediately after the war, he took an academic post in the United States, and for over forty years he maintained a considered silence on those terrible years, addressing them only obliquely through his poetry. After years in the making There Was A Country presents his towering reckoning with one of modern Africa's most fateful experiences, both as he lived it and came to understand it. Marrying history and memoir, with the author's poetry woven throughout, There Was a Country is a distillation of vivid observation and considered research and reflection. It relates Nigeria's birth pangs in the context of Achebe's own development as a man and a writer, and examines the role of the artist in times of war. Reviews: 'No writer is better placed than Chinua Achebe to tell the story of the Nigerian Biafran war ... [The book] makes you pine for the likes of Achebe to govern ... We have in There Was a Country an elegy from a master storyteller who has witnessed the undulating fortunes of a nation' Noo Saro-Wiwa, Guardian 'Chinua Achebe's history of Biafra is a meditation on the condition of freedom. It has the tense narrative grip of the best fiction. It is also a revelatory entry into the intimate character of the writer's brilliant mind and bold spirit. Achebe has created here a new genre of literature' Nadine Gordimer 'Part-history, part-memoir, [Achebe's] moving account of the war is laced with anger, but there is also an abiding tone of regret for what Nigeria might have been without conflict and mismanagement' Sunday Times About the author: Chinua Achebe was born in Nigeria in 1930. He published novels, short stories, essays, and children's books. His volume of poetry, Christmas in Biafra, was the joint winner of the first Commonwealth Poetry Prize. Of his novels, Arrow of God won the New Statesman-Jock Campbell Award, and Anthills of the Savannah was a finalist for the 1987 Booker Prize. Things Fall Apart, Achebe's masterpiece, has been published in fifty different languages and has sold more than ten million copies. Achebe lectured widely, receiving many honors from around the world. He was the recipient of the Nigerian National Merit Award, Nigeria's highest award for intellectual achievement. In 2007, he won the Man Booker International Prize. He died in 2013.",'Biography & Autobiography',3.76,452578,27163,4.5,329,2012
Chinua Achebe,Another Africa,"Two great talents have joined together to create a unique d gorgeous book that fuses photographs, poetry, and text to create a view of present-day Africa that moves beyond the stereotypes commonly held by most Westerners. There are no shots of beautiful sand dunes and tropical savannas where herds of wildlife roam. Instead, this work peels away myths to explore the complexity, diversity, and human dimensions of a place called Africa -- one that celebrates the commonplace and exotic simultaneously. The ninety full-color photographs are highly subjective, a personal investigation that reflects the sensibilities, formal concerns, and the ongoing engagement of the photographer Robert Lyons. With the brilliant Chinua Achebe, a Nigerian, contributing his never-before-published poems and an essay, the book takes on another dimension. He presents a concise view of Africa today, including the individual and political issues facing its countries. His poems and his essay, written specifically for this book, deal with Africa on its own terms -- from within.This beautifully produced book with text by a ""magical writer -- one of the greatest of the twentieth century"" (Margaret Atwood) will be irresistible to anyone interested in Africa.",'Photography',3.76,452578,27163,5.0,465,2013

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,One World,"This book is made up of twenty-three stories, each from a different author from across the globe. All belong to one world, united in their diversity and ethnicity. And together they have one aim: to involve and move the reader. The range of authors takes in such literary greats as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Jhumpa Lahiri, and emerging authors such as Elaine Chiew, Petina Gappah, and Henrietta Rose-Innes. The members of the collective are: Elaine Chiew (Malaysia) Molara Wood (Nigeria) Jhumpa Lahiri (United States) Martin A Ramos (Puerto Rico) Lauri Kubutsile (Botswana) Chika Unigwe (Nigeria) Ravi Mangla (United States) Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (Nigeria) Skye Brannon (United States) Jude Dibia (Nigeria) Shabnam Nadiya (Bangladesh) Petina Gappah (Zimbabwe) Ivan Gabirel Reborek (Australia) Vanessa Gebbie (Britain) Emmanual Dipita Kwa (Cameroon) Henrietta Rose-Innes (South Africa) Lucinda Nelson Dhavan (India) Adetokunbo Abiola (Nigeria) Wadzanai Mhute (Zimbabwe) Konstantinos Tzikas (Greece) Ken Kamoche (Kenya) Sequoia Nagamatsu (United States) Ovo Adagha (Nigeria) From the Introduction: The concept of One World is often a multi-colored tapestry into which sundry, if not contending patterns can be woven. for those of us who worked on this project, ‘One World’ goes beyond the everyday notion of the globe as a physical geographic entity. Rather, we understand it as a universal idea, one that transcends national boundaries to comment on the most prevailing aspects of the human condition. This attempt to redefine the borders of the world we live in through the short story recognizes the many conflicting issues of race, language, economy, gender and ethnicity, which separate and limit us. We readily acknowledge, however, that regardless of our differences or the disparities in our stories, we are united by our humanity. We invite the reader on a personal journey across continents, countries, cultures and landscapes, to reflect on these beautiful, at times chaotic, renditions on the human experience. We hope the reach of this path will transcend the borders of each story, and perhaps function as an agent of change. Welcome to our world.",'Fiction',4.31,1295770,119314,5.0,641,2017

Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmare vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality.

George Orwell,Animal Farm a Fairy Story,"Animal Farm is an allegorical novella by George Orwell, first published in England on 17 August 1945. The book tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer, hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal, free, and happy. Ultimately, however, the rebellion is betrayed, and the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before, under the dictatorship of a pig named Napoleon. According to Orwell, the fable reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union. Orwell, a democratic socialist, was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism, an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the Spanish Civil War. The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutal dictatorship built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described Animal Farm as a satirical tale against Stalin (""un conte satirique contre Staline""), and in his essay ""Why I Write"" (1946), wrote that Animal Farm was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, ""to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole"".",'Political Science',4.11,10253035,305087,5.0,135,2000

George Orwell,1984 by George Orwell,"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him. The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a meter wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move.

George Orwell,Down and Out in Paris and London,"In ""Down and Out in Paris and London,"" George Orwell intricately weaves a narrative that explores the harrowing realities of poverty and social injustice through his keen observations of life on the margins. The book oscillates between the bustling streets of Paris and the grim atmospheres of London, capturing the essence of transient existence in a tone that is both poignant and satirical. Through vivid descriptions and a memoir-like style, Orwell immerses the reader in the struggles of the destitute, providing a profound social commentary that reflects the socio-economic disparities of the early 20th century. George Orwell, born Eric Arthur Blair, was profoundly influenced by his experiences in the working class, which led him to adopt a politically charged perspective throughout his literary career. His time spent in the slums of London and the impoverished quarters of Paris instilled a deep empathy for the downtrodden, motivating him to highlight the human condition. This autobiographical account not only reveals Orwell's disdain for capitalism but also showcases his commitment to truth and transparency in writing. ""Down and Out in Paris and London"" is essential reading for those seeking to understand the societal structures that perpetuate inequality. With its unflinching honesty and powerful insight, it invites readers to confront the uncomfortable realities of poverty, making it a compelling and thought-provoking exploration that resonates well beyond its time.",'Social Science',4.11,10253035,305087,5.0,228,1950

In ""Mr. Harrigan's Phone,"" an intergenerational friendship has a disturbing afterlife. ""The Life of Chuck"" explores, beautifully, how each of us contains multitudes. And in ""Rat,"" a struggling writer must contend with the darker side of ambition. If these stories show King's range, they also prove that certain themes endure. One of King's great concerns is evil, and in If it bleeds, there's plenty of it. There is also evil's opposite, which in King's fiction often manifests as friendship. In this collection, Holly is reminded that friendship is not only life-affirming but can be lifesaving. Young Craig befriends Mr. Harrigan, and the sweetness of this connection is its own reward. King also reminds us that life's quotidian pleasures are even more glorious because they are fleeting: the outrageous good fortune of a beautiful blue day after a string of gray ones; the delight of dancing really well, when every move feels perfect; a serendipitous meeting. It's in these moments that King's ability to describe pure joy rivals his ability to terrify us. --",'Fiction',4.07,21440043,1080988,5.0,5,2021
